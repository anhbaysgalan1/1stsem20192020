INTRODUCTION
------------

Beep Tracking System is a mobile and web application to track and manage Beep. Beep (Bus-Jeep) is a 
modern public utility vehicle in Cebu and has been running since Decemeber 2018. The application aims
to promote the use of the bus-jeep aptly known as BEEP. Its primary purpose is to provide a way for 
the commuter to track and check whether any BEEP unit is in the close vicinity or know its estimated
time of arrival to wherever bus stop the user is. This gives the commuters a sense of how long they 
would have to wait for the next BEEP unit.

There are 2 mobile applications and 1 web application:
	1. Commuter's Mobile Application (BTS Commuter)
	2. Driver's Mobile Application (BTS Driver)
	3. Admin's Web Application (https://beep-db-d2d2b.web.app/)
